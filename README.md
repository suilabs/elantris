> *This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) +
  [backpack-react-scripts](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-react-scripts/tree/master/packages/react-scripts).*
  It is very similar to one that you would create using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
  without [backpack-react-scripts](https://github.com/Skyscanner/backpack-react-scripts/tree/master/packages/react-scripts),
  so please refer to [it's documentation](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md)
  for more usage information.
